## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Click on the text area for times you have a deadline or important event. When in the future, the box will be green. When the box is red, that means you are in that current hour.
When the box is grey, that means it is in the past and you will no longer be able to type a new message in the box to avoid confusion.
